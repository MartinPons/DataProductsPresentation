## The Motivation

- One Of the main sources for getting toursim related data in Spain is the Touristic Studies Institute (IET).
- The data is presented in the form of time series tables
- Students from tourism degrees in Spain could get a better global vision if this data were displayed in animated charts

## The Process

- Ann App was developed using slidify package in R software
- The original app gets the data direclty from the (IET). However, for the course project this data is first downloaded and then readed locally.
- Four time series From the IET were used for the app:
  1. Total number of visitors in Spain by tipology (Tourists and Excursionists)
  2. Total number of tourists in Spain by region
  3. Average days spent in Spain by tourists from the main tourists provider countries
  4. Mean daily expenditures by tourist form the main tourist provider contries
- A preprocessing, cleaning and formatting of the data was carried out in order to display the desired charts
- The charts were built using rCharts an GoogleVis packages from R

## The App

- Three charts are displayed in the app:
  1. Total number of visitors in Spain in differnent levels of aggregation
  2. Interannual growth rates in different regions in Spain
  3. An animated chart in time displaying the average number of days spent by international tourists from different countries in Spain vs. the main daily expenditures from tourist in these countries.

## A Real Example

We display here one of the charts built using rCharts

``````{r, results='asis'}
require(rCharts)
data<-read.csv("assets/inter.regions.csv")
m1<-mPlot(x=as.character("Date"), y="Catalonia", data=data, type="Line")
m1$print('chart1')
```
